## Number of homeless people

### Data: The Point In Time Count

Every two years, communities that receive funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are requried to conduct a count of sheltered and unsheltered homeless people on a single night, known as the Point-In-Time count. The count includes unsheltered people sleeping outdoors, in cars, or in other places that are not meant for overnight use, and people who are in shelters.

The Point-In-Time count does not include people at risk of homelessness such as people living in doubled-up or crowded conditions or people who may be living in fear of domestic violence. And it only counts people on a single night, so does not capture people who may cycle in and out of homelessness in short periods but are not included in the single-night count. Thus, many more people may be homeless at some point during a year than are homeless on a single night. By some measures the number of people served by homelessness programs in San Francisco over the course of a year is more than double the Point-In-Time count. But the Point-In-Time count is conducted regularly using definitions and methods intended to be reasonably uniform across communities and over time, so they are useful for comparative purposes.

The PIT count ordinarily had been conducted in odd-numbered years, but the 2021 count was disrupted in 2021 by Covid-19 and was only a partial count. As a result, San Francisco conducted a new count in February 2022 that was complete.

```

The figure and table below show San Francisco Point-In-Time counts from 2005 through 2022. The glimmer of hope is in the red line, which shows that the number of unsheltered homeless declined by 15.1 percent between 2019 and 2022. This, in conjunction with data further below showing that direct exits from homelessness into permanent supportive housing increased by 81 percent between 2021 and 2022 suggests that city efforts may finally be reducing the number of unsheltered homeless people, and moving many into permanent supportive housing.

### Comparisons to other cities

The Point in Time count allows comparisons to other cities. The following figure, prepared by the city Controller's office as part of [City Performance Scorecards benchmarking site](https://sfgov.org/scorecards/benchmarking/homelessness), compares sheltered and unsheltered counts per 100,000 residents in San Francisco to those in selected other cities.[^1] The differences across cities are striking. San Francisco is 5th-highest ranked among the cities shown, and highest among the California cities - although not much different from Los Angeles or Berkeley.

[^1]: Technically, the comparisons are to HUD-defined areas, known as Continuums of Care, that include these cities.

However, San Francisco and other California cities have far greater numbers of unsheltered homeless people than do most eastern and northern cities. For example, San Francisco and New York City have similar total numbers of homeless people, relative to their populations, but San Francisco has more than 10 times as many unsheltered homeless people (512 per 100,000 for San Francisco compared to 47 for New York City).[^2]

[^2]: The reasons for these differences are complex, but include differences in weather that make unsheltered homelessness more dangerous or difficult in colder climates, and court decisions and consent decrees that require shelter in New York City

## Direct exits from homelessness

San Francisco tracks exits from homelessness through three main kinds of programs: Permanent Supportive Housing, Rapid rehousing, and Problem Solving.

Permanent Supportive Housing places households into long-term affordable housing with a range of supportive services, including case management and housing retention assistance. Rapid Rehousing is a time-limited subsidy for tenants to live in private-market units and access supportive services. Problem Solving includes relocation assistance, financial assistance, and other interventions to divert or rapidly exit people from homelessness. The city's major problem solving program is Homeward Bound, which is designed to help homeless individuals with ties to another community leave the streets and return to the communities from which they came. It provides participants with one-way bus tickets, assistance in finding temporary housing, and other relocation services.

In city fiscal year 2021-22 exits through PSH surged, increasing 81 percent versus 2020-21, as a result of the city's previous large investments in Permanent Supportive Housing. (See figure below.)

# Spending on homelessness

## Overview

![](images/image-398531333.png)

Note: much of this is based on 2022-23 and 2023-24 proposed budget @groffenbergerProposedBudgetFiscal2022.

-   Only county in the Bay Area to see a decrease in unsheltered homelessness since 2019 (to 2022).

-   Budget homelessness proposals

    -   funding to keep three shelter-in-place hotels open

    -   new site in Mission community for up to 70 new cabins

    -   new funding to end homelessness for transgender residents

    -   Mental Health SF

    -   treatment beds

    -   Street Response Teams

    -   funding to support/allow higher wages for frontline staff in City PSH buildings

    -   \$25.4 million over the two years to continue support for the Mid-Market Safety Ambassadors, who are focused on cleanliness and providing a more welcoming environment for residents, workers, and visitors in the areas around the Tenderloin, Civic Center, and Market Street

    -   \$7.2 million over the two years to support an enhanced Tenderloin cleaning initiative, which will expand Public Works' current cleaning operations in the area. This proposal will fund one dedicated work crew to provide daily daytime cleaning services during the week and maintain a healthy, safe, and clean environment to improve quality of life and work conditions for residents and businesses in the Tenderloin area.

    -   \$5.0 million over the two years to support enforcement of the street vending ordinance

    -   maintains investments in the Street Crisis Response Teams (SCRT), Street Wellness Response Teams (SWRT), and Street Opioid Response Team (SORT). Maintaining these efforts are critical in preventing overdoses and connecting people experiencing acute crises to treatment.

    -   augment the City's existing Street Response teams with communitybased organizations (CBOs). This proposed budget appropriates those funds and will leverage that source to support CBOs in strengthening their outreach teams to be better integrated with the City's non-emergency and non-medical calls for service. The CBO teams will collaborate with the City's Street Response teams in responding to 3-1-1 calls and service requests. The teams will provide a client-centered approach

    -   a new investment in the Recreation and Parks Department's Park Rangers. Park Rangers are a positive, helpful, and unarmed presence in the City's public spaces who promote public safety while protecting parks. This budget expands the Park Ranger Unit by ten additional rangers to a total of 61 positions, expanding their presence at the City's network of 225 parks. Many of these locations are high-traffic and high-visibility areas, including Dolores and Golden Gate Parks.

    -   City is on track to exceed its goal of adding 1,500 units of permanent supportive housing through purchasing 1,513 units and leasing 1,032 units this year.

    Budget

    -   \$13.95b 2023, \$13.85b 2024

    -   \~half+ self-supporting, enterprises; rest is GF from taxes, federal, state

    -   10% wage increase over 2 years

Based on HHAP3 as a starting point:

-   State programs

    -   CalWORKS Housing Support CDSS. HSP assists homeless and housing- vulnerable CalWORKs families. Services include rental assistance, temporary hotel rooms, support for moving-related costs, and wraparound case management. Target pop is CalWORKs families who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. (HHAP3) HSP is described [here](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/Housing/Housing%20Support%20Program%20(HSP)%20Fact%20Sheet_January%202021.pdf). However, HHAP3 seemed to be describing Homeless Assistance. The CalWORKs Homeless Assistance (HA) Program was established to help families in the CalWORKs program meet the costs of securing or maintaining permanent housing or to provide emergency shelter when a family is experiencing homelessness. CalWORKs HA program serves eligible CalWORKs recipients or apparently eligible CalWORKs applicants, who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. CalWORKs HA can provide payments for temporary shelter for up to 16 days, as well as payments to secure or maintain housing, including a security deposit and last month's rent, or up to two months of rent arrearages. ([web](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/calworks-homeless-assistance))

    -   Bringing Families Home (BFH) CDSS. Bringing Families Home is a state-funded, locally administered program that provides support to eligible families experiencing homelessness in the child welfare system by offering financial assistance and housing- related wrap-around supportive services. Services may include rental assistance, housing navigation, case management, legal services, credit repair, or payments to help with security deposits, utilities, moving costs. (HHAP3) The Bringing Families Home (BFH) Program was established by Assembly Bill (AB) 1603 (Chapter 25, Statutes of 2016) and updated by Senate Bill (SB) 80 (Chapter 27, Statutes 2019) to reduce the number of families in the child welfare system experiencing or at risk of homelessness, to increase family reunification, and to prevent foster care placement.

        The 2019-20 California Budget Act included a state appropriation of \$25 million General Fund (one-time) for BFH, available for a three-year period from July 2019 through June 2022. The program requires a dollar-for-dollar grantee match, bringing the total program budget to \$50 million.

        BFH offers financial assistance and housing-related wrap-around supportive services, including, but not limited to: rental assistance, housing navigation, case management, security deposits, utility payments, moving costs, hotel and motel vouchers, legal services, and credit repair. ([web](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/bringing-families-home-program))

    -   Housing and Disability Advocacy CDSSm HDAP funding suports activities that assist people experiencing homelessness who are likely eligible for disability benefits. The four core HDAP service components are housing assistance, disability advocacy, outreach, and case management. (HHAP3)

    -   Home Safe CDSS Provides specialized and highly- intensive case management and other stabilizing services to Adult Protective Services (APS) clients experiencing or at-risk of homelessness; can include long-term interventions such as assisted living placements. (HHAP3)

    -   Project Roomkey and Rehousing CDSS - Project Roomkey leases and provides services at hotels to provide Interim Housing with an exit strategy for homeless people needing these services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (HHAP3)

    -   Other - HSA claims CalFresh Employment & Training (CFET) funding for CFET-eligible clients who reside in DHSH Masterlease housing. Reimbursement rate is 50% or eligible costs. (HHAP3)

-   Federal programs

    -   Emergency Solutions Grants - CV (ESG-CV) HUD - ESG leases and provides services at hotels to provide Interim Housing with an exit strategy for homeless people needing these services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (HHAP3)

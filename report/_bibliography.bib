  abstract = {Homelessness in California. While homelessness is a complex problem with many causes, the high costs of housing is a significant factor in the state's homelessness crisis. Rising housing costs that have exceeded growth in wages, particularly for low-income households, put Californians at risk of housing instability and homelessness. In California, around 2.5 million low-income households are cost burdened. More people experience homelessness in California than any other state. As of January 2020\textemdash the most recent year federal data is available\textemdash California had about 161,500 individuals experiencing homelessness. Shifting State-Local Relationship. Historically, local entities have provided most of the homelessness assistance in their jurisdiction, relying in part on federal and state funding. As the homelessness crisis has become more acute, the state has taken a larger role in funding and supporting local governments' efforts to address homelessness. The state has increased its role in addressing homelessness by providing significant, albeit one-time and temporary, funding towards infrastructure and flexible aid to local governments in recent years. Update on Key Recent Homelessness State Spending. Recent budget actions reflect the increased role of the state in addressing homelessness. The state budget provided a total of \$7.2 billion (\$3.3 billion General Fund) in 2021-22 to about 30 homelessness-related programs across various state departments. We provide implementation updates for several of the major, recent homelessness augmentations. Homelessness Package Proposes to Focuses on Near-Team Needs. The Governor's 2022-23 budget proposes \$2 billion one-time General Fund over two years that is intended to address near-term homelessness needs while previously authorized funds for long-term housing solutions are implemented: \$1.5 billion for behavioral health ``bridge'' housing and \$500 million for the Encampment Resolution Grants Program. Devote Attention to Overseeing Recent Augmentations. We suggest the Legislature dedicate the early part of the budget process to overseeing the implementation of last year's significant homelessness augmentations. Prior to authorizing increased funding for the activities proposed in the 2022-23 budget, ensuring that the homelessness efforts authorized in prior budgets are operating effectively, adequately supported, and can be maintained over time will be important. Consider Long-Term Plan for Ongoing Homelessness Efforts. Addressing this crisis requires a complex combination of services and infrastructure. As more information about recent state efforts becomes available, we suggest the Legislature assess which types of interventions appear most effective. This information could help guide the state's long-term fiscal and policy role in addressing homelessness. For Any Authorized Funds, Set Clear Expectations and Establish Metrics to Assess Performance. Setting clear expectations through statute and establishing reporting requirements to facilitate oversight over the state's progress towards addressing homelessness will be critical.},

MOI's objectives are (1) to help long-term, stabilized tenants of permanent supportive housing (PSH) in San Francisco move into independent housing through the use of a Housing Choice Voucher and (2) to use the opening created when a person ``moves on'' from PSH to house chronically homeless individuals currently living on the streets or in shelters. When MOI works well, it creates greater efficiencies in the homelessness response system by ensuring that resources are allocated based on individual need.},

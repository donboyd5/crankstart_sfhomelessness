The best way to get a nearly-full picture of San Francisco spending related to homelessness is from the City's application to the state for a grant under Round 3 of the Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention (HHAP) program. That program requires local governments to prepare a local action plan, which includes "A local landscape analysis that assesses the current number of people experiencing homelessness and existing programs and funding which address homelessness within the jurisdiction" (@californiahomelesscoordinatingandfinancecouncilHomelessHousingAssistance2022).

### About the data

The tables below summarize the landscape analysis included in the city's HHAP-3 application (@cityofsanfranciscoHomelessHousingAssistance2022). These data were challenging for the city to develop and are challenging to interpret, so it's important to understand what they represent.

The city's HHAP-3 application includes spending data for four major agencies that are heavily involved in services for the homeless: the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing (HSH), the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD), the Department of Public Health (DPH), and Human Services Agency (HSA). HSH was the lead agency in preparing the application.

HSH obtained data from each of the four agencies on planned spending for as many of city fiscal years 2021-22 through 2024-25 as were available to HSH. The data can be for different multi-year periods because of different budgeting arrangements at federal, state and local levels, and because of changes in programs in place. The HHAP-3 landscape analysis includes just one number for each major spending category - the sum of planned spending in that category over those years. The application also includes information on which years the number pertains to. Agencies did not provide year-by-year estimates of spending.

For example, HSH reported that it planned to spend \$139.1 million of state funds on the "HomeKey" program over 2021-22 and 2022-23 (an average of \$69.6 million over the two years), and it planned to spend \$19.1 million for federal Emergency Housing Vouchers (EHVs) over the three years from 2021-22 through 2023-24 (an average of \$6.4 million).

It's important for readers to understand several things about the following tables:

-   The tables include federal and state spending that goes through the San Francisco budget, in addition to spending funded by local taxes.

-   This is true in general of amounts shown in the San Francisco budget, although this may not always be evident to readers of the city budget. While it is important to understand total spending, only the local piece is paid for directly by San Francisco taxpayers. (San Francisco taxpayers do contribute to federal and state spending through the federal and state taxes they pay, but these amounts are not paid for out of local taxes.)

-   In each table, the rightmost column of numbers is the sum of spending funded by the three levels of government.

-   The annual averages are a useful way of understanding the totality of spending, but they do not represent San Francisco spending in any particular year. Some programs are phasing down while others are phasing up. About 59 percent of spending was averaged over the three years from 2021-22 through 2023-24, 21 percent was averaged over 2021-22 through 2024-25, and most of the remainder was for 2021-22 or averaged over 2021-22 and 2022-23.

-   Spending on homelessnes is "lumpy" in the sense that it has been driven upward by one-time federal support and one-time state support related to the pandemic. Much of this support is winding down or will wind down, and managing this decline is an important issue for HSH.

-   Spending has been driven upward by the Proposition C Gross Receipts Tax for Homelessness Services, approved by San Francisco voters in November 2018.

-   One spending item in the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development did not have associated information on the source of funds (the extent to which the item was financed by federal, state, or local funds). In the tables below, I have distributed this across federal, state, and local sources in the same manner as the overall MOHCD budget is distributed.

-   The tables show planned (i.e., budgeted) spending, not actual spending. I don't believe that's a significant issue - while in planned and actual spending by governments can differ significantly, particularly in a single year, it is unlikely to lead to a misleading view of average spending over multiple years.

#### Our City, Our Home, and Proposition C

Proposition C was passed by San Francisco voters in November 2018. Proposition C imposed an additional tax on gross receipts for certain large businesses in San Francisco, with the tax rate depending on the size of the business. Revenue from the tax is used to fund programs for homeless services and affordable housing in the city.

The Our City, Our Home Fund program was created as a result of Proposition C. The fund provides funding for homelessness services and affordable housing programs in San Francisco, with the goal of reducing homelessness and increasing access to affordable housing in the city. The fund is administered by MOHCD and the money is used to support a range of programs and initiatives, including rental assistance, permanent supportive housing, and temporary shelters.

The plan for Our City, Our Home was for funding to be allocated to the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, the Mayor's Office on Housing and Community Development, and the Department of Public Health. In the first few years, most funding was intended to be allocated to construction costs after which funding would go toward operating costs and services. According to the intial plan, "funding contracted out to non-profits will be carefully overseen by contracting managers in said department. Contract managers will carefully scrutinize budgets, check receipts, payroll records, perform audits and ensure funding is spent appropriately." (For details on Proposition C and Our City, Our Home as proposed, see [this](https://www.ourcityourhomesf.org/san_francisco_prop_c_2018_explained).)

In addition to HSH, the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD) and the Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD) deliver OCOH-funded permanent housing services).

A separate section discuss OCOH in more detail, based largely on the [OCOH 2021-22 annual report](https://sf.gov/data/ocoh-fund-annual-report-fy21-22-executive-summary).

Looking ahead to OCOH spending, the OCOH oversight committee said this on December 15, 2022 (@LookingAhead2023):

> The Fund \[is\] in a period of weakness rather than strength, with the result that the budgeting process is likely to feel more constrained. Final fund balance amounts will come from the mid-March forecast reported in the 5-Year Plan Update. Long story short: final budget amounts won't be available until mid-March. Departments will be submitting their budget proposals to the Mayor's budget office on Friday 3/31/2023.

#### Local General Fund

All programs of HSH not funded by Our City, Our Home or by the state or federal governments is funded from the general fund, financed by local taxes and other revenue sources.

### 
Temporary and one-time funding

See [this](https://sf.gov/data/ocoh-fund-annual-report-fy21-22-executive-summary#overview-of-ocoh-budget-and-expenditures).

Particularly during FY20-21 and continuing into FY21-22, the City received significant federal and state support for various programs, including [CARES Act](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/about-the-cares-act) funding, FEMA funding, and [Project Roomkey](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/cdss-programs/housing-programs/project-roomkey) funding. The City appropriated the OCOH Fund for essential shelter and homelessness prevention programming, and expenditures against these appropriations will increase once COVID-19 relief funding from federal and state sources expire.

## The Mayor's Comments on Homelessness Spending in the 2022-23 Budget

Note: much of this is based on 2022-23 and 2023-24 proposed budget @groffenbergerProposedBudgetFiscal2022.

-   Only county in the Bay Area to see a decrease in unsheltered homelessness since 2019 (to 2022).

-   Budget homelessness proposals

    -   funding to keep three shelter-in-place hotels open

    -   new site in Mission community for up to 70 new cabins

    -   new funding to end homelessness for transgender residents

    -   Mental Health SF

    -   treatment beds

    -   Street Response Teams

    -   funding to support/allow higher wages for frontline staff in City PSH buildings

    -   \$25.4 million over the two years to continue support for the Mid-Market Safety Ambassadors, who are focused on cleanliness and providing a more welcoming environment for residents, workers, and visitors in the areas around the Tenderloin, Civic Center, and Market Street

    -   \$7.2 million over the two years to support an enhanced Tenderloin cleaning initiative, which will expand Public Works' current cleaning operations in the area. This proposal will fund one dedicated work crew to provide daily daytime cleaning services during the week and maintain a healthy, safe, and clean environment to improve quality of life and work conditions for residents and businesses in the Tenderloin area.

    -   \$5.0 million over the two years to support enforcement of the street vending ordinance

    -   maintains investments in the Street Crisis Response Teams (SCRT), Street Wellness Response Teams (SWRT), and Street Opioid Response Team (SORT). Maintaining these efforts are critical in preventing overdoses and connecting people experiencing acute crises to treatment.

    -   augment the City's existing Street Response teams with communitybased organizations (CBOs). This proposed budget appropriates those funds and will leverage that source to support CBOs in strengthening their outreach teams to be better integrated with the City's non-emergency and non-medical calls for service. The CBO teams will collaborate with the City's Street Response teams in responding to 3-1-1 calls and service requests. The teams will provide a client-centered approach

    -   a new investment in the Recreation and Parks Department's Park Rangers. Park Rangers are a positive, helpful, and unarmed presence in the City's public spaces who promote public safety while protecting parks. This budget expands the Park Ranger Unit by ten additional rangers to a total of 61 positions, expanding their presence at the City's network of 225 parks. Many of these locations are high-traffic and high-visibility areas, including Dolores and Golden Gate Parks.

    -   City is on track to exceed its goal of adding 1,500 units of permanent supportive housing through purchasing 1,513 units and leasing 1,032 units this year.

    Budget

    -   \$13.95b 2023, \$13.85b 2024

    -   \~half+ self-supporting, enterprises; rest is GF from taxes, federal, state

    -   10% wage increase over 2 years

Based on HHAP3 as a starting point:

-   State programs

    -   CalWORKS Housing Support CDSS. HSP assists homeless and housing- vulnerable CalWORKs families. Services include rental assistance, temporary hotel rooms, support for moving-related costs, and wraparound case management. Target pop is CalWORKs families who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. (HHAP3) HSP is described [here](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/Housing/Housing%20Support%20Program%20(HSP)%20Fact%20Sheet_January%202021.pdf). However, HHAP3 seemed to be describing Homeless Assistance. The CalWORKs Homeless Assistance (HA) Program was established to help families in the CalWORKs program meet the costs of securing or maintaining permanent housing or to provide emergency shelter when a family is experiencing homelessness. CalWORKs HA program serves eligible CalWORKs recipients or apparently eligible CalWORKs applicants, who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. CalWORKs HA can provide payments for temporary shelter for up to 16 days, as well as payments to secure or maintain housing, including a security deposit and last month's rent, or up to two months of rent arrearages.

    -   Bringing Families Home (BFH) CDSS. Bringing Families Home is a state-funded, locally administered program that provides support to eligible families experiencing homelessness in the child welfare system by offering financial assistance and housing- related wrap-around supportive services. Services may include rental assistance, housing navigation, case management, legal services, credit repair, or payments to help with security deposits, utilities, moving costs. (HHAP3) The Bringing Families Home (BFH) Program was established by Assembly Bill (AB) 1603 (Chapter 25, Statutes of 2016) and updated by Senate Bill (SB) 80 (Chapter 27, Statutes 2019) to reduce the number of families in the child welfare system experiencing or at risk of homelessness, to increase family reunification, and to prevent foster care placement.

        The 2019-20 California Budget Act included a state appropriation of \$25 million General Fund (one-time) for BFH, available for a three-year period from July 2019 through June 2022. The program requires a dollar-for-dollar grantee match, bringing the total program budget to \$50 million.

        BFH offers financial assistance and housing-related wrap-around supportive services, including, but not limited to: rental assistance, housing navigation, case management, security deposits, utility payments, moving costs, hotel and motel vouchers, legal services, and credit repair.

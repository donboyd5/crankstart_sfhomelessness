  abstract = {This report is a preliminary assessment of the early implementation of the Moving On Initiative (MOI). MOI's objectives are (1) to help long-term, stabilized tenants of permanent supportive housing (PSH) in San Francisco move into independent housing through the use of a Housing Choice Voucher and (2) to use the opening created when a person ``moves on'' from PSH to house chronically homeless individuals currently living on the streets or in shelters. When MOI works well, it creates greater efficiencies in the homelessness response system by ensuring that resources are allocated based on individual need.},
